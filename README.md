# The makemore bot

Makemore takes one text file as input, where each line is assumed to be one training text, and generates more text like it. 

In every lecture folder, there is a note.md file for you guys to read. It walks through the entire video with detail, along with plenty of my own thoughts and clarifications.

- Jupyter notebook in every lecture in github to let you check out the product.
- Andrej's jupyter notebook is [here](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero/blob/master/lectures/makemore). It's more completed and detailed.
